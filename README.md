## Introduction
Welcome to the 'Sorting Algorithm Visualiser'! This is the software that I developed for my A Level Computer Science project.

The purpose of this project was to make an application that allowed two different sorting algorithms to run simulatneously on the same initial data set, allowing a user to copmare and contrast the efficiency of different sorting algorithms. The user is able to customise the starting data set to test the limits of each sorting algorithm and design them to exhibit worst-case and best-case scenarios.

I hope you find this a useful tool for learning about different sorting algorithms and seeing them in action!

## How to use
The application features a help window which provides:
- descriptions of the sorting algorithms implemented,
- instructions on how to customise your animation preferences for the sorting algorithm visulisations,
- instructions on how to use this application, and what the buttons do.

To navigate to the help window, click the **?** button at the top right corner of the main window.
